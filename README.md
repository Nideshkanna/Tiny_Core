# Microwatt + Sensor Fusion Accelerator on OpenFrame

## Overview

This project integrates the **open-source Microwatt POWER CPU core** with a custom **sensor fusion accelerator**, implemented on the **OpenFrame harness**.

Unlike Caravel/Caravan, OpenFrame provides only the essential padframe, power-on-reset, and project ID ROM, giving us a clean slate to implement our custom SoC.

Our design demonstrates how an open-source CPU can be extended with a dedicated hardware accelerator to efficiently process real-time sensor data from IoT and wearable devices.

## Motivation

IoT and wearable devices rely heavily on **real-time sensor data processing** (accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, etc.). Software-only solutions consume significant power and add latency.

By integrating a **hardware accelerator** directly with Microwatt, we enable:

- âš¡ Faster sensor fusion computations
- ðŸ”‹ Lower power consumption
- ðŸ“‰ Reduced latency for event detection
- ðŸ”§ Demonstration of practical **open-source SoC customization** on OpenFrame

This aligns with the hackathonâ€™s theme of **"Microwatt for the open computing era"**, showing how open CPUs can be adapted for edge AI and IoT.

## Key Features of Our Design

1. **Microwatt CPU Integration**
    - Lightweight POWER ISA core
    - Acts as the main controller for sensor data management
2. **Custom Sensor Fusion Accelerator**
    - Implements weighted averaging
    - Kalman-filter inspired pre-processing
    - Threshold-based event detection (e.g., fall detection, anomaly alerts)
    - Exposed as memory-mapped peripheral to Microwatt
3. **OpenFrame Harness Advantages**
    - ~15mmÂ² user area for CPU + accelerator
    - 44 configurable GPIOs for sensor connections and debugging
    - Simplified I/O with direct access to padframe

## Target Applications

- IoT edge devices
- Wearables (fitness tracking, health monitoring, fall detection)
- Low-power industrial monitoring sensors

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository

```
git clone <repo_url>
cd microwatt_sensorfusion
make setup
```

### 2. RTL Integration

- Place Microwatt + accelerator Verilog under `verilog/rtl/`
- Update `openlane/sensorfusion/config.json` with:
    - `DESIGN_NAME` = top-level module
    - `VERILOG_FILES` = list of source files
    - `CLOCK_PERIOD` = 25ns (40 MHz target)

### 3. Hardening Flow

```
make sensorfusion
make openframe_project_wrapper
```

**4. Run Precheck**

```
make run-precheck
```

Ensure power connections use `vccd1_connection` and `vssd1_connection` macros.

## Deliverables

- âœ… Open-source RTL (Microwatt + accelerator)
- âœ… Testbenches and verification reports
- âœ… Hardened GDS via OpenLane flow
- âœ… Precheck logs and validation reports
- âœ… Documentation + final video demo
- âœ… MIT/Apache 2.0 licensed GitHub repository
